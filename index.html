       <h2>AP Macro principles in real time</h2>
      <p> If you are reading this, you are most likely a student in AP Macroeconomics. Good for you! This class, while rather challenging, can introduce to you vital skills, knowledge, and resources that you can use to for a variety of things. From increasing your financial stability to creating a basis for your knowledge in economics, there are endless ways to utilize your gains from this class.</p>
     <p>As a fellow AP Macroecon student, one thing I though could be helpful was if we could see the real impact and examples of what we learn. During COVID-19, how much did employment rise? How much has GDP grown over the last year? These are just two examples of the countless other question that might pop into our minds as we study macroeconomics. So, I intend for this site to be a tool to allivate you of the weight of at least a few of these questions. With information from the Federal Reserve of St. Louis(FRED), I have compiled a variety of graphs and charts that directly link to the terms we learn in class, so that we can see how some of these seemingly "theoretical only" terms we learn affect us in real life and how they change during real life events.</p>
